## Project Initiation: Tech Stack
This week you will revisit an existing project or pitch an entirely new idea. Begin with your research and then return to this document. Fill out the headings below with your Tech Stack information. List the tools and technology you would like to use for your project. Explain your reasoning for this as well. For example, how does the proposed tool or technology provide value to your overall portfolio of work? 
  

**Note:** If you plan to work on an existing project, review the "Change Order" instructions below as well.

## Application Design

What tool(s) will you use to create click-through designs of the application? List any UI kits you would like to utilize as well. 

I will be using React and Node for this project as it is the one I am most comfortable with, I would like to also try using Sanity and Next.js for this project. Next.js will be used for file-based routing and data using server-side rendering and static generation. Sanity provides the ability to add and edit products on the go for database management. It should help manage the entire content of project.

## Front End Framework

List your approach for front end development. For example, React is an often used front-end solution for projects in addition to using moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.   

I will utilize ReactJS for the front end design.

## State Management

What is your proposed solution for managing data? This could mean utilizing a database, local-storage, and in general state management libraries for the application (e.g. Redux).    

React Redux and React Content API will be used to manage the state of the application.

## Node

Node is often used to serve both an API and to render a front-end. This includes using best practices, npm, and npx. What do you propose? 

Node will be used as that is what I am familiar with.


## Express

Express is a popular framework to power an API. Describe your idea for building similar functionality offered by express: e.g. middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

At the present moment I will use ExpressJS


## SQL/Postgres/Sequelize

A popular solution for relational database work is to utilize Sequelize as an ORM. Are you familiar with migrations, models, and seeding? What tools and solutions do you propose for your application? For example, utilizing an ORM to build out models with full validated CRUD.

I am familiar with SQL and MongoDB but I am more comfortable with MongoDB. For this project Sanity will be used for CRUD operations as well.

# Change Order
If you have an existing project, make sure the tech stack is captured in this document. Also include the following informaton:

* Confirm this document summarizes the proposed tech stack: Yes or ? 
* Is there any additional tool or technology you may like to use for this project given enough time?
* List and describe any proposed changes to the original tech stack

Keep in mind, approval is needed for proposed work and may include peer or instructor review(s). If you are unsure about your proposed ideas feel free to reach out to us for guidance.
